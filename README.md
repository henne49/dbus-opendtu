## Introduction

This project integrates (supported) Hoymiles Inverter into Victron Energy's (Venus OS) ecosystem.
It works upon [openDTU](https://github.com/tbnobody/OpenDTU) respectively [AhoyDTU](https://github.com/lumapu/ahoy) and also with other generic REST Devices (template configuration needed to include them).

## Installation

With the scripts in this repo, it should be easy possible to install, uninstall, restart a service that connects the OpenDTU or Ahoy to the VenusOS and GX devices from Victron.

### Get the code

Just grap a copy of the main branch and copy the content to `/data/` e.g. `/data/dbus-opendtu`.
After that call the `install.sh script.

The following commands should do everything for you:

```bash
wget https://github.com/henne49/dbus-opendtu/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip "dbus-opendtu-main/*" -d /data
mv /data/dbus-opendtu-main /data/dbus-opendtu
chmod a+x /data/dbus-opendtu/install.sh
```

‚ö†Ô∏è**Edit the following configuration file according to your needs before proceeding**‚ö†Ô∏è see [Configuration](#configuration) for details.

```bash
nano /data/dbus-opendtu/config.ini
```

Tha last step is to install the service and remove the downloaded files:

```bash
/data/dbus-opendtu/install.sh
rm main.zip
```

Check configuration after that - because the service is already installed and running. In case of wrong connection data (host, username, pwd) you will spam the log-file! Also, check to **set a** proper (minimal) **log level**

### Configuration

Within the project there is a file `/data/dbus-opendtu/config.ini`. Most important is the DTU variant, Host and Username and Password, if you use authentication.

#### Default options

| Config value        | Explanation   |
|-------------------- | ------------- |
| SignOfLifeLog  | Time in minutes how often a status is added to the log-file `current.log` with log-level INFO |
| NumberOfTemplates | Number ob Template Inverter to query |
| DTU |  Which DTU to be used ahoy, opendtu or template REST devices Valid options: opendtu, ahoy, template |
| useYieldDay | send YieldDay instead of YieldTotal. Set this to 1 to prevent VRM from adding the total value to the history on one day. E.g. if you don't start using the inverter at 0. |
| ESP8266PollingIntervall |  For ESP8266 reduce polling intervall to reduce load, default 10000ms|
| Logging | Valid options for log level: CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, NOTSET, to keep logfile small use ERROR or CRITICAL |
 MagAgeTsLastSuccess | Maximum accepted age of ts_last_success in Ahoy status message. If ts_last_success is older than this number of seconds, values are not used.  Set this to < 0 to disable this check.                                    |
| DryRun | Set this to a value different to "0" to prevent values from being sent. Use this for debugging or experiments. |
| Host | IP or hostname of ahoy or OpenDTU API/web-interface |
| HTTPTimeout | Timeout when doing the HTTP request to the DTU or template. Default: 2.5 sec |
| Username | use if authentication required, leave empty if no authentication needed |
| Password | use if authentication required, leave empty if no authentication needed |

#### Inverter options

This applies to each `INVERTER[X]` section. X is the number of Inverter starting with 0. So the first inverter is INVERTER0, the second INVERTER1 and so on.

| Config value        | Explanation   |
|-------------------- | ------------- |
| Phase | which Phase L1, L2, L3 to show|
| DeviceInstance | Unique ID identifying the OpenDTU in Venus OS|
| AcPosition | Position shown in Remote Console (0=AC input 1; 1=AC output; 2=AC input 2) |
| Servicename | e.g. com.victronenergy.pvinverter see [Service names](#service-names) |

#### Template options

This applies to each `TEMPLATE[X]` section. X is the number of Template starting with 0. So the first template is TEMPLATE0, the second TEMPLATE1 and so on.

| Config value        | Explanation   |
|-------------------- | ------------- |
| Host | IP or hostname of Template API/web-interface |
| Username | use if authentication required, leave empty if no authentication needed |
| Password | use if authentication required, leave empty if no authentication needed |
| DigestAuth | TRUE if authentication is required using Digest Auth, as for Shelly Plus Devices, False if you Basic Auth to be used|
| CUST_SN | Serialnumber to register device in VenusOS|
| CUST_API_PATH | Location of REST API Path for JSON to be used |
| CUST_POLLING | Polling interval in ms for Device |
| CUST_Total | Path in JSON where to find total Energy |
| CUST_Total_Mult | Multiplier to convert W per minute for example in kWh|
| CUST_Power | Path in JSON where to find actual Power |
| CUST_Power_Mult | Multiplier to convert W in negative or positive |
| CUST_Voltage | Path in JSON where to find actual Voltage |
| CUST_Current | Path in JSON where to find actual Current |
| CUST_DCVoltage | Path in JSON where to find actual DC Voltage (e.g. Batterie voltage) *1|
| Phase | which Phase L1, L2, L3 to show|
| DeviceInstance | Unique ID identifying the OpenDTU in Venus OS|
| AcPosition | Position shown in Remote Console (0=AC input 1; 1=AC output; 2=AC input 2) |
| Name | Name to be shown in VenusOS, use a descriptive name |
| Servicename | e.g. com.victronenergy.pvinverter see [Service names](#service-names) |

Example for JSON PATH: use keywords separated by /

*1: is only used if Servicename is com.victronenergy.inverter

### Service names

The following servicenames are supported:

* com.victronenergy.pvinverter
* com.victronenergy.inverter

The difference between the two is that the first one is used as a PV inverter connected to the grid like a Fronius or SMA inverter. The second one is used for a battery inverter like a Victron AC Inverter.
For more Information about non-pv-inverters, see this [Issue #42](https://github.com/henne49/dbus-opendtu/issues/42).

It is possible that other servicenames are supported, but not tested. If you have a device with a different servicename, please open an issue.
  
### Videos how to install

Here are some videos on how to install and use the script. They are in German, but you can use subtitles and auto-translate to your language.
*(Don't be confused that the config they used is not the actual one.)*

## Usage

This are some useful commands which helps to use the script or to debug.

### Check if script is running

`svstat /service/dbus-opendtu` show if the service (our script) is running. If number of seconds show is low, the it is probably restarting and you should look into `/data/dbus-opendtu/current.log`.

### How to debug

`dbus-spy` show all DBus values interactively.

This is useful to check if the script is running and sending values to Venus OS.

### How to install

`/data/dbus-opendtu/install.sh` installs the service persistently (see above).

This also activates the service, so you don't need to run `svcadm enable /service/dbus-opendtu` manually.

### How to restart

`/data/dbus-opendtu/restart.sh` restarts the service - e.g. after a config.ini change.

This also clears the logfile, so you can see the latest output in `/data/dbus-opendtu/current.log`.

### How to uninstall

`/data/dbus-opendtu/uninstall.sh` stops the service and prevents it from being restarted (e.g. after a reboot).

If you want to remove the service completely, you can do so by running `rm -rf /data/dbus-opendtu`.

## How does it work

The script is inspired by @fabian-lauer dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter implementation. So what is the script doing:

* Running as a service
* Connecting to DBus of the Venus OS `com.victronenergy.pvinverter.http_{DeviceInstanceID_from_config}`
* After successful DBus connection, OpenDTU (resp. Ahoy) is accessed via REST-API - simply the `/status` (resp. `api/live`) is called which returns a JSON with all details.
  * A sample JSON file from OpenDTU can be found [here](docs/OpenDTU.json).
  * A sample JSON file from Ahoy can be found [here](docs/ahoy_0.6.9_live.json)
* Serial/devicename is taken from the response as device serial
* Paths are added to the DBus with default value 0 - including some settings like name etc.
* After that, a "loop" is started which pulls OpenDTU/AhoyDTU data every 5s (configurable) from the REST-API and updates the values in the DBus, for ESP 8266 based ahoy systems we even pull data only every 10seconds.

Thats it üòÑ

## Tested Devices

The code allows you to query either an Ahoy or OpenDTU Device, plus multiple template based (PV) Inverter in a single script.

Following combinations are possible:

* Use one or more devices configured via template configuration
* Use a OpenDTU device
* Use a AhoyDTU device
* Use either a OpenDTU or a AhoyDTU device and one or more template devices.

Tested examples for template devices:

* Tasmota unauthenticated
* Shelly 1 PM authenticated/unauthenticated
* Shelly Plus 1 PM unathenticated

All [configuration](#configuration) is done via config.ini. Examples are commented in config.ini

## Troubleshooting

Please open a new issue on github, only here we can work on your problem in a structured way: <https://github.com/henne49/dbus-opendtu/issues/new/choose>

‚ö†Ô∏è **Change the Logging Parameter under DEFAULT in /data/dbus-opendtu/config.ini to Logging = DEBUG, please revert, once debugging and troubleshooting is complete. Rerun the script and share the current.log file**.

Please provide the config.ini and JSON file and upload to the github issues, you can download the JSON file using your browser or using a commandline like tool like curl

| Type of DTU | URL |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| OpenDTU | <http://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_IP_OR_HOSTNAME/api/livedata/status> |
| Ahoy | <http://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_IP_OR_HOSTNAME/api/live> |
| Template Tasmota| <http://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_IP_OR_HOSTNAME/cm?cmnd=STATUS+8> |
| Template Shelly 1 | <http://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_IP_OR_HOSTNAME/status> |
| Template Shelly Plus | <http://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_IP_OR_HOSTNAME/rpc/Switch.GetStatus?id=0> |
| Template Your Own | You will know best|

OpenDTU Curl example which uses jq to make the output pretty:

```bash
curl http://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_IP_OR_HOSTNAME/api/livedata/status | jq > export.json
```

also describe the problem as best as you can.

Please also show, what you can see in Venus OS and VRM Portal, as the source of truth is Venus OS and not VRM.

### Security settings in OpenDTU

For openDTU, you can use authentication for the web Interface, but allow access to the status page unauthenticated. For this please use the settings like below.
