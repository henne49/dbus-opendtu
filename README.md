# dbus-opendtu/ahoydtu inverter
Integrate openDTU or ahoyDTU and with that all Hoymiles Interverter https://github.com/tbnobody/OpenDTU into Victron Energies Venus OS. This also allows for template configuration to include other generic REST Devices. 

The code allows to query up to one DTU, either ahoy or opendtu, plus multiple Template based PV Inverter in a single script. This means, you can also only query template devices or only a dtu, or a mix of one DTU and template devices.

Tested Examples:

    * Tasmota unauthenticated
    * Shelly 1 PM authenticated/unauthenticated
    * Shelly Plus 1 PM unathenticated

All configuration is done via config.ini examples are commented in config.ini

## Purpose
With the scripts in this repo it should be easy possible to install, uninstall, restart a service that connects the opendtu to the VenusOS and GX devices from Victron.
Idea is inspired on @fabian-lauer & @vikt0rm project linked below.



## Inspiration
This project is my first on GitHub and with the Victron Venus OS, so I took some ideas and approaches from the following projects - many thanks for sharing the knowledge:
- https://github.com/fabian-lauer/dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter
- https://shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud/gen1/#shelly1-shelly1pm
- https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/wiki/dbus#pv-inverters
- https://github.com/vikt0rm/dbus-shelly-1pm-pvinverter
- https://github.com/tbnobody/OpenDTU 
- https://github.com/tbnobody/OpenDTU/blob/master/docs/Web-API.md
- https://ahoydtu.de/


## How it works


### Details / Process
As mentioned above the script is inspired by @fabian-lauer dbus-shelly-3em-smartmeter implementation.
So what is the script doing:
- Running as a service
- connecting to DBus of the Venus OS `com.victronenergy.pvinverter.http_{DeviceInstanceID_from_config}`
- After successful DBus connection OpenDTU/ahoyDTU is accessed via REST-API - simply the /status is called and a JSON is returned with all details
  A sample JSON file from OpenDTU can be found [here](docs/OpenDTU.json). A sample JSON file from OpenDTU can be found [here](docs/ahoy.json)
- Serial/devicename is taken from the response as device serial
- Paths are added to the DBus with default value 0 - including some settings like name, etc
- After that a "loop" is started which pulls OpenDTU/AhoyDTU data every 5s from the REST-API and updates the values in the DBus, for ESP 8266 based ahoy systems we even pull data only every 10seconds

Thats it üòÑ

## Install & Configuration
### Get the code
Just grap a copy of the main branche and copy them to a folder under `/data/` e.g. `/data/dbus-opendtu`.
After that call the install.sh script.

The following script should do everything for you:
```
wget https://github.com/henne49/dbus-opendtu/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip "dbus-opendtu-main/*" -d /data
mv /data/dbus-opendtu-main /data/dbus-opendtu
chmod a+x /data/dbus-opendtu/install.sh
nano /data/dbus-opendtu/config.ini
```

‚ö†Ô∏èEdit and change the config file to your needs and save‚ö†Ô∏è

```
/data/dbus-opendtu/install.sh
rm main.zip
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Check configuration after that - because service is already installed an running and with wrong connection data (host, username, pwd) you will spam the log-file, also check to set right ‚ö†Ô∏èminimal log level‚ö†Ô∏è as possible

### Change config.ini
Within the project there is a file `/data/dbus-opendtu/config.ini` - just change the values - most important is the deviceinstance, custom name and phase under "DEFAULT" and host, username and password in section "ONPREMISE". More details below:

| Section  | Config vlaue | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| DEFAULT  | SignOfLifeLog  | Time in minutes how often a status is added to the log-file `current.log` with log-level INFO |
| DEFAULT  | NumberOfTemplates | Number ob Template Inverter to query |
| DEFAULT  | DTU |  Which DTU to be used ahoy, opendtu or template REST devices Valid options: opendtu, ahoy, template |
| DEFAULT  | useYieldDay | send YieldDay instead of YieldTotal. Set this to 1 to prevent VRM from adding the total value to the history on one day. E.g. if you don't start using the inverter at 0. |
| DEFAULT  | ESP8266PollingIntervall |  For ESP8266 reduce polling intervall to reduce load, default 10000ms|
| DEFAULT  | Logging | Valid options for log level: CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, NOTSET, to keep logfile small use ERROR or CRITICAL |
| DEFAULT | MagAgeTsLastSuccess | Maximum accepted age of ts_last_success in Ahoy status message. If ts_last_success is older than this number of seconds, values are not used.  Set this to < 0 to disable this check.                                    |
| DEFAULT  | DryRun | Set this to a value different to "0" to prevent values from being sent. Use this for debugging or experiments. |
| DEFAULT  | Host | IP or hostname of ahoy or OpenDTU API/web-interface |
| DEFAULT  | Username | use if authentication required, leave empty if no authentication needed |

## Troubleshooting

Please open a new issue on github, only here we can work on your problem in a structured way: https://github.com/henne49/dbus-opendtu/issues/new/choose

Please provide the config.ini and JSON file and upload to the github issues, you can download the JSON file using your browser or using a commandline like tool like curl. 

| Type of DTU | URL |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| OpenDTU | http://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_IP_OR_HOSTNAME/api/livedata/status |
| Ahoy | http://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_IP_OR_HOSTNAME/api/live |
| Template Tasmota| http://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_IP_OR_HOSTNAME/cm?cmnd=STATUS+8 |
| Template Shelly 1 | http://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_IP_OR_HOSTNAME/status |
| Template Shelly Plus | http://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_IP_OR_HOSTNAME/rpc/Switch.GetStatus?id=0 |
| Template Your Own | You will know best|

OpenDTU Curl example which uses jq to make the output pretty: 
```
curl http://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_IP_OR_HOSTNAME/api/livedata/status | jq > export.json
```
also describe the problem as best as you can.

Please also show, what you can see in Venus OS and VRM Portal, as the source of truth is Venus OS and not VRM.
